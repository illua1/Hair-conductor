# Hair-conductor-for-corridor-geometry
This is a script for Blender 3d 2.8 to create a geometry of hair in shape

I donâ€™t know if I will do anything else (there is no way to make support for the particles of hair yet). 
The plans: 
-The generation of a new object for the hair mesh. 
-Selection, mesh generation of an object or vector. 
-The ability to generate bones according to the plan of the hair frame. 
-Auto link vertex weights to the new skeleton. 
-Add a bezier curve to position hair points. 
-Adding a menu to create a full add-on.
